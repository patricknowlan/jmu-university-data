#JMU University Data
James Madison University data for you to build apps with. This repo currently contains informaiton on professors and buildings owned / employed by JMU. We will add data as we expand this repo so if you have a request create an issue.

#Reason
When I was a student at JMU i wasted precious time manually pulling this data together. Now I get straight from the university and or scrape it from various sources. Speed up your development and or add this data to your app!

#Future
Eventually this will become an API. Don't hold your breath :)

#Contributing
If you would like to make an update to the data or add a feature to this repo, Please Do! Create me a pull request or and issue if your not a developer!
